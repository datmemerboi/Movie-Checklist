# Movie Checklist
## Maintain a list of movies
### Using Python, PyQt5, MongoDB, MongoClient

As an avid movie lover, I have a large list of movies completed and yet to watch. As I had to keep track of that, here's an application to checklist the movies I have completed.

*Note:* 
Default Mongo connection:`mongodb://localhost:27017`
Database: `Movie`
Collection: `Checklist`

(If the db is altered, it will be updated here)
