# Movie Checklist
## Maintain a list of movies
### Using Python 3, PyQt5, MongoDB, MongoClient

As an avid movie lover, I have a large list of movies completed and yet to watch. As I had to keep track of them, here's an application to checklist the movies you have completed.

You will require *Python, PyQt5, MongoDB* and *MongoClient*. After installing these, just run `index.py`.

*Note:* 

Default Mongo connection:`mongodb://localhost:27017`

Database: `Movie`

Collection: `Checklist`

(If the database is altered, it will be updated here)
