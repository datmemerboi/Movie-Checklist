# Movie Checklist
## Maintain a list of movies
### Using Python 3, PyQt5, MongoDB, MongoClient

As an avid movie lover, I have a large list of movies completed and yet to watch. As I had to keep track of them, here's an application to checklist the movies you have completed.

Built on Linux environment (Elementary OS).

### Requirements
**Python, PyQt5, MongoDB** and **MongoClient**. After installing them, just run `index.py`.
Running `setup.py` would help you install the required softwares.
